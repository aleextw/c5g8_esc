Home page:

- currency selector (P1): query, copy from kaligo
- open up dialog or change to another route for log in/ register onClick (P2)
- add other features after the req are done (P3...)

- fix how ui looks (only the css file need work)

- fix clear button (rn it only appears if there is a word that matches the data, and disappears if there is no matching data)


Booking page:
- go to another page when click "book"
- pass the data from the earlier pages to the booking page to display
- go back when "cancel" is clicked


- for passing info from a page to another, look at around 1h 9mins of vid

(need this to pass the info from the home page to the hotel/ country to show data that fulfills the cond)

(pass the info as a string for the user (only for viewing) in the booking page)
